So my program has to be compiled and run in a IDE to be used. Otherwise the program explains
how to use itself.

## Prerequisites
* You must have a GitHub account. You can sign up for free at [github.com](https://github.com)!

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the Hackathon GitHub project at [https://github.com/shasta-sou-hackathon/2020_hackathon](https://github.com/shasta-sou-hackathon/2020_hackathon).
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top of the page and create your own fork of the project.
3. Create a new folder on your computer and clone your fork of the project into that folder:<br />
`git clone https://github.com/<your_account_name>/2020_hackathon.git`
4. Import the project into your favorite IDE and start getting creative with your code!

## Rules
* All code must be written in Java and/or Python.
* All code submissions must be received by 5:00pm PDT on the day of the event (see the **Submissions** section below). Any commits after this time will be ignored.
* Have fun!

## Submissions
When you are done writing your code, it's time to commit your changes to the Git project and push up your code for submission.

First, add all your code:

`git add --all`

Next, commit all your changes (the commit message is up to you):

`git commit -m 'My 2020 Hackathon submission!'`

Finally, push your commit up to your GitHub fork:

`git push origin master`

**Note**: We encourage you to make commits of your code throughout the Hackathon (this is good practice to save your work)!

## Judging
* Only your `master` branch will be judged. However, feel free to use other branches during your development.
* The following criteria will be considered for judging:
	* _Creativity/Originality_ - How cool/unique was your idea? Does it tie in well with the Mt. Shasta theme?
	* _Code Elegance_ - How does your code flow? How is the structure/formatting?
	* _Technical Difficulty_ - How difficult is your code to understand? Does it solve problems efficiently or by brute force?
	* _Polish_ - Did you spend any time on finishing touches or just call it "good enough"?
	* _Functionality_ - Does it work?

Shasta Networks will announce 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners by the following weekend.
